= MQTT Wildcard Publishes

WARNING: MQTT is not designed for Wildcard Publishes! This Extension is built only for fun purposes and should not be
used for anything else.

This HiveMQ Extension enables Wildcard Publishes.

== How to use

As any correctly implemented MQTT Brokers should do, does HiveMQ not allow the use of Topic filters in Publish packets. This
requires the use of "PLUS" instead of "+" and "HASH" instead of "#" in the Publish Topic (filter).

=== Examples

"topic/+/#" will be "topic/PLUS/HASH".
