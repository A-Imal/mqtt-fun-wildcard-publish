= MQTT Wildcard Publishes

WARNING: MQTT is not designed for Wildcard Publishes! This Extension is built only for fun purposes and should not be
used for anything else.

This HiveMQ Extension enables Wildcard Publishes.

== How to use

As a correctly implemented MQTT Brokers should does HiveMQ not allow the use Topic filters for Publish packets. This
means that we need to switch to "PLUS" instead of "+" and "HASH" instead of "#".

=== Examples

"topic/+/#" will be "topic/PLUS/HASH".
